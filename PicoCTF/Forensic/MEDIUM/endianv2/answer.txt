xxd -e challengefile | xxd -r > stonks.jpg

-e : Convert to little endian
-r : convert (or patch) hex dump into binary

Basically, this will print out the hexes of challengefile, but in little endian. Then we pipe it to the second command, which will package the piped hex dump into a new file call "stonks.jpg".
