<html><head/><body><p>While supporting the REGEXP operator SQLite doesn't implement any regular expression<br/>algorithm but calls back the running application. DB Browser for SQLite implements this<br/>algorithm for you to let you use REGEXP out of the box. However, as there are multiple possible<br/>implementations of this and you might want to use another one, you're free to disable the<br/>application's implementation and load your own by using an extension. Requires restart of the application.</p></body></html>
