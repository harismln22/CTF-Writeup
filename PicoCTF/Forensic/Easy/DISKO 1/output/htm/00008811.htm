Activate this if you want to use the <span style=" font-style:italic;">load_extension()</span> function from SQL code.</p><p>For security reasons, extension loading is turned off by default and must be enabled through this setting. You can always load extensions through the GUI, even though this option is disabled.</p></body></html>
